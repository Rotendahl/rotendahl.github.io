# Introduction

The default start page in my browser of choice (safari) suck. The page looks nice
but does not sync between devices, and shows a lot of useless information.
@fig-safari shows the safari start page. The "favorites" section is a copy of
the links in my favorites bar, which is already visible in the browser. The
"Shared with you" section is a list of links that my partner has shared with me
they are all old and was never really relevant. I don't use the reading list in
safari, the entries are all old and read or was added by mistake.
The bottom row is useful part of the start page, as it allows me to access tabs
from my iPad and iPhone, but the [tab group feature in safari][tab-groups]
superseeds this.

# The solution

I would like my start page to present the configured links in a grid with the
same layout on all devices. The links should be static to ensure "muscle memory" of
their placement, similar to app placement on my phone home screen. The themeing
should switch between light and dark mode depending on the system configuration.
A design that meets these simple requirements can also be seen in in figure @fig-safari.

Implementing this design is can be done with the following html and css:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Start Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="variables.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="container">
      <a href="https://site-a.com">
        <img src="https://logo-a.png" />
        <p>Site A</p>
      </a>

      <a href="https://site-b.com">
        <img src="https://logo-b.png" />
        <p>Site B</p>
      </a>

      <a href="https://site-c.com">
        <img src="https://logo-c.png" />
        <p>Site C</p>
      </a>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## style.css

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fout%2Fstyle.css&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

## variables.css

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fout%2Fvariables.css&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

To make the start page "responsive" we add a flexbox to the container div and
set each link with a fixed max width this along with the `flex-wrap: wrap` property
ensures that the links flow nicely to the next row when the screen is too small
making it work on phones and smaller browser windows.

## Configuring the start page
To make the above html fit your taste requires:
* Setting your color theme in the `variables.css` file.
* Adding `<a>` tags with each site you want to include.

This last point is a bit tedious, but could be done in a few minutes, but that's
no fun.

# Overengineering the solution

The above solution of manually adding the `<a>` tags would be the smart way to
proceed. Instead we are going to overengineer a tool that will do this for us,
while stretching our haskell muscles. We will create a custom data format, a
parser and a template engine to generate the html above, lastly we will setup a
CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the start page to github pages.

## Defining the favorite sites.

The sites to show are listed in the format

```txt
some arbitrary text
* youtube.com/feed/subscriptions/ <- <logo-url>
* Github.com
* Data Science -> towardsdatascience.com
* Sentry.io
* Azure DevOps -> dev.azure.com <- <logo-url>
```

In essence a links file can contain two types of text lines, comments and favorites.
A comment is any line that does not start with a `*` and a favorites is any line that
does. A favorite must have a url, the url can be preceded by a display name and
an arrow `->`. The display name can contain any characters except `->` after the
url an optional logo url can be added. The logo url must be preceded by `<-`.
This gives us the following context free grammar:

```txt
  favorites ::=  * favorite \n favorites | Îµ
  favorite ::= display-name -> site | site
  display-name ::= <text>
  site ::= url | url <- logo
  url ::= <text>
  logo ::= <text>
```

Where `<text>` is any string of characters that does not contain `->` or `<-` or
newlines.

While the grammar is simple it does require some lookahed i.e when parsing a
display name you don't know if it's indeed a display name or a url.

See my current list of favorites below.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flinks.txt&style=default&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

## Haskell up in here, up in here.

To setup our haskell project we use [cabal][cabal] and initialize the project
with

```bash
cabal init
```

This will create a [start-page-generator.cabal](https://github.com/Rotendahl/Start-Page-Generator/blob/master/Start-Page-Generator.cabal)
file along with lib and test folders.

### Defining the types.

The next step is to define the types we'll use for our parser and template engine,
A site in the start page is defined by three properties:

- The url of the site
- The name of the site
- The logo of the site

The last two are optional, if no name is given we'll use the hostname and if no
logo is provided we use `logo.clearbit.com//<hostname>` which gives us a logo.

We use the Maybe monad to represent the optional values and map from the
`ParsedSite` to the `Site` type with the above logic.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2FSiteTypes.hs&style=default&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

### Parsing the links file

Haskell is excelent for writing parsers, instead of writing clunky regexes that
are hard to read and maintain we can use the parser combinator library: [parsec][parsec].

The main idea behind parser combinators is that you can build a parser for each
part of the grammar and then combine them to build a parser for the entire grammar.
For parsing a site we need to parse a '\*' character, an optional display name,
followed by an url and an optional logo url.
This gives us the parser

```haskell
parseSite :: Parser ParsedSite
parseSite = do
  _ <- string "*"
  whiteSpace
  name <- optionMaybe $ try parseDisplayName
  url <- parseUrl
  logo <- optionMaybe $ try parseLogo
  return (name, url, logo)
```

Which is much easier to read than a regex. See the full parser below.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2FFavoritesParser.hs&style=default&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

### Generating the html

We read the sample file use the mapper and then generate the html.

### Testing

Functional code is easy to test, thus we must do so. This is done using the
exceptional [hspec](https://hspec.github.io/) library which uses the behavior
driven development style of testing.

## DevOps

Seting up a simple CI/CD pipeline using github actions, was done by setting
an action that lints and test all commits.

Any commit to the master branch will trigger a build and deploy to github pages. Github pages is used as it's free and easy to setup.
