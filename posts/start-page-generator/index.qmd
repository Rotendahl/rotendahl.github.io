# Introduction

The default start page in my browser of choice (safari) suck. The page looks nice
but does not sync between devices, and shows a lot of useless information.
@fig-safari shows the safari start page. The "favorites" section is a copy of
the links in my favorites bar, which is already visible in the browser. The
"Shared with you" section is a list of links that my partner has shared with me
they are all old and was never really relevant. I don't use the reading list in
safari, the entries are all old and read or was added by mistake.
The bottom row is useful part of the start page, as it allows me to access tabs
from my iPad and iPhone, but the [tab group feature in safari][tab-groups]
superseeds this.

# The solution

I would like my start page to present the configured links in a grid with the
same layout on all devices. The links should be static to ensure "muscle memory" of
their placement, similar to app placement on my phone home screen. The themeing
should switch between light and dark mode depending on the system configuration.
A design that meets these simple requirements can also be seen in in figure @fig-safari.

Implementing this design is can be done with the following html and css:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Start Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="variables.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="container">
      <a href="https://site-a.com">
        <img src="https://logo-a.png" />
        <p>Site A</p>
      </a>

      <a href="https://site-b.com">
        <img src="https://logo-b.png" />
        <p>Site B</p>
      </a>

      <a href="https://site-c.com">
        <img src="https://logo-c.png" />
        <p>Site C</p>
      </a>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## style.css

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fout%2Fstyle.css&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

## variables.css

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fout%2Fvariables.css&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

To make the start page "responsive" we add a flexbox to the container div and
set each link with a fixed max width this along with the `flex-wrap: wrap` property
ensures that the links flow nicely to the next row when the screen is too small
making it work on phones and smaller browser windows.

## Configuring the start page
To make the above html fit your taste requires:
* Setting your color theme in the `variables.css` file.
* Adding `<a>` tags with each site you want to include.

This last point is a bit tedious, but could be done in a few minutes, but that's
no fun.

# Overengineering the solution

The above solution of manually adding the `<a>` tags would be the smart way to
proceed. Instead we are going to overengineer a tool that will do this for us,
while stretching our haskell muscles. We will create a custom data format, a
parser and a template engine to generate the html above, lastly we will setup a
CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the start page to github pages.

## Defining the favorite sites grammar.

A favorite consists of a url, a display name and a logo, the last two are optional.
We could have used a format such as json or csv as the configuration file format,
but instead we create our own format, @lst-grammar-example shows an example of
the format. The idea of the grammar is to have the non optional url in the center
of a line, if there is a display name it precedes the url and _points_`->`
to the url. A logo optionally succeeds the url and _points_ back `<-` to the url.

```{#lst-grammar-example .txt lst-cap="Example grammar instance"}
some arbitrary text
* youtube.com/feed/subscriptions <- <logo-url>
* Github.com
* Data Science -> towardsdatascience.com
* Sentry.io
* Azure DevOps -> dev.azure.com <- <logo-url>
```



A links file can contain two types of text lines: comments and favorites.
A comment is any line that does not start with a `*` and a favorite is any line
that does. A favorite must have a url, but can optionally have a display name and
a logo as specified above. The grammar for the favorite sites file can be seen
in [BNF][bnf] form in @lst-grammar-bnf.

```{#lst-grammar-bnf .txt lst-cap="The favorite sites grammar in BNF form"}
  favorites ::= * <favorite> \n <favorites> | ε
  favorite ::= <display-name> -> <site> | <site>
  display-name ::= <text>
  site ::= <url> | <url> <- <url>
  url ::= <url-spec>
```
Where `<text>` is any string of characters that does not contain `->` or `<-` or
newlines and `<url-spec>` is any valid url. The grammar follows the [lexeme][lexeme]
convention of parsing, where we allow arbitrary whitespace between tokens, and
treat any lines not prefixed with a `*` as whitespace.

The grammar is non left recursive, non ambiguous requiring no precedence rules,
the only downside of the grammar is that it requires lookahead for display names.
When reading the lexeme following a `*` we don't know if it is a display name or
url until we observe a `->` or the lack of it. Since the display name is are
short this will not be a problem in practice[^1].

### Full grammer file
<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flinks.txt&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on&"></script>

## Creating the project
To setup our haskell project we use [cabal][cabal] and initialize the project with
```bash
cabal init
```

This will create a [start-page-generator.cabal](https://github.com/Rotendahl/Start-Page-Generator/blob/master/Start-Page-Generator.cabal)
file along with lib and test folders.

In typical haskell fashion we start by creating the types we need for our
parser/(template engine). The types can be seen below:

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2FSiteTypes.hs&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

Note that the logo type is simply a type alias for the url. The `ParsedSite` type
has the optional display name and logo url via the maybe monad. Our template
engine will map between the `ParsedSite` and `Site` types filling in the optional
fields. For the display name we use the hostname of the url if no display name is
present. A missing logo url is filled in with `logo.clearbit.com//<hostname>`
which provides a logo for most sites.

### Testing
Being a functional langauge Haskell has many great testing libaries from
simple [unit testing][hunit] to [property based testing][quickcheck]. For this
project we use the BDD style [hspec][hspec] library. The tests are simple
assertions that given the specific input the code produces the expected output.
<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Ftest%2FTemplateEngineSpec.hs&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>


## Parsing the links file

Haskell is excellent for writing parsers, instead of writing clunky regexes that
are hard to read and maintain we use the parser combinator library: [parsec][parsec].

The main idea behind parser combinators is that you build a parser for each
part of the grammar and then combine them to build a parser for the entire grammar.
For parsing a site we need to parse a '\*' character, an optional display name,
followed by an url and an optional logo url.
This gives us the parser

```haskell
parseSite :: Parser ParsedSite
parseSite = do
  _ <- string "*"
  whiteSpace
  name <- optionMaybe $ try parseDisplayName
  url <- parseUrl
  logo <- optionMaybe $ try parseLogo
  return (name, url, logo)
```

Which is much easier to read than a regex. See the full parser below.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2FFavoritesParser.hs&style=default&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

## Generating the html
To map from the parsed we map from the parsed sites to the site type and replace
the template tag in the html with the generated html.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRotendahl%2FStart-Page-Generator%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2FTemplateEngine.hs&style=github-dark&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>



# Deploying the site
For deploying static html githubs pages is the obvious choice. Prior to setting
up a deployment pipeline we first setup a testings pipeline. The testing pipeline
uses the [Setup haskell](https://github.com/haskell/actions) action which gives
us a ghc environment. The test pipeline runs the tests and runs the [hlint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint)
utility which ensures that the code is idiomatic haskell.

For the deploy pipeline it builds the code saves the output to a branch called
gh-pages and deploys the site to github pages. Both pipelines can be found at
https://github.com/Rotendahl/Start-Page-Generator/tree/master/.github/workflows
and the deployed code can be found at https://rotendahl.dk/Start-Page-Generator/
