# Checklists & templates
For the last couple of years, mainly after reading the books [Atomic Habits]
and [Checklist Manifesto], I've used templates based checklists, such lists can
change habits, behaviors, and of course avoid mistakes.

As an example of the latter, imagine you are on a trip/vacation and realize you
forgot to pack some item your favorite sunglasses, phone charger, or something
else. What action can you take to avoid this?

By maintaining a _trip packing_ checklist you can add the missing item to this list
and be confident that you will not forget it again.

For the behavior change part, I've add actions such as `read an article/chapter`
when I wanted to read more, and added `plan exercise` to my weekly review checklist
to help me exercise more. Each day I would invoke my daily checklist template
and run through it over the course of the day.

## Enter daily themes
As the current daily checklist has grown, and grown it's become harder to
consistently complete it. I take this a sign that the checklist has worked and
more actions just kept creeping in.

To solve this creep I've instead split it out to a base checklist with core
actions such as `Clean unread emails` that should be completed every day and a
variety of _themed_ checklist.
My current themes are:

* Health: Exercise, relax, and sleep well.
* Project: Work on a side project, build something fun.
* Learning: Learn something new.
* Social: Connect with friends and family.
* Admin: Handle laundry, emails, and other administrative tasks/chores.

To my weekly review checklist, I've added a task to plan the themes for the
upcoming week. Not every theme gets a day, I might not have an _admin_ day every
week, opting instead for an extra project/health day and two social days over
the weekend.


## Setting up the tech for checklists
I've set up a system that can manage the checklists templates and handle the
logic of choosing which theme to invoke. It can also execute side effects I.e
logging the choice of template to a sheet etc.
The requirements for the tech stack are:

- I should be able to easily active the template from anywhere.
    - This means that I should be able to activate it from at least my phone, if
      it required access to my mac that would suck. It would also be nice if I
      was still able to active it from my mac, iPad, etc. So I don’t need to get
      out my phone if I’m already at my mac.
- It should be easy to update templates and add new ones.
- It should be stable and require as little maintenance as possible.

Given the above requirements, there obvious choice for orchestrating the actions
fell on The *Shortcuts* app for apple’s platforms. This allows me to activate the
template from any of my devices, meeting the first requirement.

I did consider making my own backend in Haskell/Rust and getting the templates
via an API call from shortcuts. While this could be super fun project, it would
require more maintenance than I would like, having to run a server and keep code
up to date.

Instead I'll manage templates via a folder in ICloud Drive, since the templates
are plain text in [task paper] format I can update from all my devices, and it
will be easy to move somewhere else if I ever want to.

A problem I found after setting this up is that the shortcut “Get File” action
fails if the file is not downloaded from ICloud drive. This is super annoying as
the fix is to open the files app, find the folder, click download and run the
action again.
I hope this get’s fixed by running the shortcut often enough that iCloud drives
never decides to offload it from local to remote storage. For now I've moved all
file reading to the top of the script to ensure it side effects are only run if
all files are present

### Log of all themes
Only activating a checklist would be fine if all i wanted was a prompt asking
which theme I want. I prefer setting all the weeks themes in my calendar and
having the system pick the right one. To achieve this I've created a new calender
delegation called daily themes and added all day events with a selected theme for
each day. This works amazingly well with the calendar sets of [fantastical].
This means I can use my calendar as a way to select themes.

I've also created a sheet in [apple numbers] to log which theme was selected and
when it was completed. This enabled me to see distrution of themes over time
and if I'm completing the themes I've set.


## The daily checklist script
The actions performed by the script are:

* Invoke the base checklist
* Check if my work calendar has any events and if so invoke the _work checklist_
* Get theme from calendar, if no theme is set, ask for one and set it in the calendar
* Invoke the theme checklist

A shortcut that performs the above actions can seen in figure @fig-shortcuts.
