I’m basicaly a book horder, I have several books from amazon that I
have bought but never read. 

The types of books I have a about Computer Science, teaching, productivty, 
memoirs etc. I ended up with all these books through these steeps: 

1. I saw a book recommondation on twitter, youtube, a podcast. 
2. The recommendtation really sold the boook and I decied to purshue it
3. I got the book from Amazon and placed it on the shelf. 

The problem is that there is no step “4” which should be _reading_ the damm book. 
The main reason for the books not being read is that I don’t have a reading habbit. 


This post is about how I created a reading habbit. 

1. When should you read? 
    A habbit is best if it happens the same time each day, so chose some time of day 
    where you will set aside time for reading. I chose to set time aside each night as 
    a way to get away from screens until the next day. 
    
2. How much time does it take? 
    On one hand it would be easy to say read “x” mintues each night, but that gives 
    the problem that you might have to stop in a middle of a chapter. 
    So the best amount of reading time would be “Read the nearset whole number of chapters 
    you can in 30 mintues.” That is if one chapter took 20 minuttes just stop there. 
    
    
3. Write notes. 
    I rarely read fiction, the books I read all present some idea I want to apply in my life. 
    If you wan’t to rembemer what you read you have to take notes. Just summerize the core 
    idea of the chapter and more importanly the points that you do not agree with. 
    
    
4. Short rewview. 
    When you’re done with the book, read your notes and summerize it into a post that 
    present it’s main idea and how they can be implemented
