## The problem
[Django][django] is a python based web framework that is really easy to work
with and get something up an running quickly. If You have some experience with
web frameworks and python, you can run through their own excellent tutorial
which takes about an hour or two. Then you should be ready to use the framework
for perfectionsists with deadlines, which really is an awesome tagline.

While I prefer the elixir based webframework phenoix as a webframework
Whille django is easy to get started with and getting something to run on your
local machine simply run
```
    ./manage.py runserver
```
An you have a way to test your app locally


## 12 factor
The main idea behind a 12 factor app is to have a stateless app where all
configuration is statels.
