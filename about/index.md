My name is Benjamin Rotendahl and I love programming, teaching and building
silly things. I live in Copenhagen where I study computer science at [DIKU](http://diku.dk). I spend some of my free time time being a part of [Coding Pirates](http://codingpirates.dk) where I'm both a volunteer
teacher and on the board.
