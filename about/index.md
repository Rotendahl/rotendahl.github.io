My name is Benjamin Rotendahl, I love programming, teaching and building silly
things. I live in Copenhagen where I study computer science at [DIKU][dikuDK].
I spend some of my free time time being a part of [Coding Pirates][cpDK] where
I teach kids to code.

I've studied part time for a large part of my time at university, this has
allowed me to try different development jobs, teaching gigs and side projects.
