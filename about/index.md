## About the site

My name is Benjamin Rotendahl and I love programming, teaching and building
silly things. The idea of this site is to showcase projects, teaching material,
small guides, and random ramblings.

## About me

I live in a dormitory in Copenhagen where I study computer science at [DIKU](http://diku.dk). I spend some of my free time time being a part of [Coding Pirates](http://codingpirates.dk) where I'm both a volunteer
teacher and on the board.

## Contact

You're free to contact me on <a href="mailto:Benjamin@Rotendahl.dk">
